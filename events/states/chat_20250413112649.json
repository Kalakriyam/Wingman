Ik wil er iets specifieks mee, dus ga nog niet op de inhoud in, maar geef wel aan of het gelukt is dat die in de conversaat in mijn uitwisseling is geplakt.\n\n(Pasted clipboard content:)\nIntro\r\nhi this is yugini uh so when it comes to dealing with\r\nasynchronous Frameworks if you never dealt with them before it might be confusing\r\nand the documentation often doesn't help dealing with this confusion because\r\nthere are way too many concurrency related terms a plus overall it's\r\nrelatively new thing not something that's been a while since forever so and\r\nnot everyone uses it uh so sometimes it can be tricky to\r\nnavigate this space altogether and so one of the approaches that follows\r\nbecause of that is just writing async in front of every function and just hoping\r\nfor the best the other thing some people do is just\r\nwriting up synchronously like they used to and ignoring this part completely\r\nuh I was also asked in my previous video why I didn't use async functions for\r\ntutorial and that's a good question uh and there are actually a couple reasons\r\nfor why I didn't want to do it uh first I didn't want to make the video more complicated\r\nbut today I want to talk about this topic more in depth and show how it\r\nworks in fast API with some practice\r\nI will make some basic benchmarks and I'll try to explain some theory behind\r\nit uh the most simple as I can so let's get to it uh here we have some\r\nPractical overview\r\nendpoints and I will quickly show you what they got what functions they're\r\ndoing and how it works overall so here in our code we have uh\r\nbasic first API application uh that has those routes\r\nthere is URL list is just list of uh websites for which it will try to\r\nconnect during some Network process then uh this one will run function on a\r\nseparate process we'll go to it later and there are several types of things\r\nthat we can try to do asynchronous the first one will be emulating CPU\r\ncalculations some blocking CPU band function and it will also it take a file\r\nand just emulate some things that it does with the file it will flip instead\r\nof doing something heavy on heavy computations and this one is written\r\nwith async it doesn't use async slip because CPU band will always be blocking\r\nlike that it won't be fair to use the Sync here the other one does exactly the\r\nsame but is written with the regular function with regular style that I think\r\nnext thing you have is sending some Network requests one would be sending a\r\nsynchronous one through httpx it will just send a request to all\r\nthose URLs that we've seen asynchronously and the other one will be\r\ndoing the same thing with a sync keyword but with regular request style Library\r\nuh just uh synchronously normally and then finally we have a file reading it\r\nwill be also a synchronous and asynchronous we will just get the file\r\nuh and try to upload it to our server server will try to read it and when it's\r\nfinished it will just return done nothing else read file just uses regular\r\nstyle like you're always doing python a synchronous version will use Library\r\ncalled IO files that does this stuff asynchronously at least add claims to\r\nand now let's look at our functions so uh and the most important function that\r\nwe have is greeting it will just send us hello async world and we will try to\r\naccess this one this end point while uh trying while\r\nrunning other endpoints and we'll see if it will be blocked or if it will return\r\nat the same time so all our endpoints are combinations of reading file plus\r\ndoing something else since we're trying to do asynchronous on the whole point is to make several things at once we'll try\r\nto read file asynchronously and just try to do other stuff and see\r\nwhat's going on first of all let's try that uh to the a thing thing that uh ah there's\r\none more uh route that will try to\r\nread files synchronously but the function itself is written is written\r\nwith async uh it's like something you might do when you don't know what to do you will write\r\nit hope for the best so let's see how it will work it will show us how long it took as well\r\nso let's select the file let's select some\r\nverse no let's select the Big File actually so it will take some time to execute and\r\nwhile it's executing we'll try to read and it returned at the same time so you\r\nmight be thinking like well it seems that asynchronous keyword works you see\r\nyeah it's returned deployment done and all other stuff so it worked fine\r\nand didn't block anything but now let's see the regular read file synchronous\r\nthat will use our synchronous function without a sync keyword as well\r\nand execute it and now let's try to grid and it also returns right away so I'll\r\nclear and show it also returns right away and here it also doing the same\r\nthing so then does it actually make any difference if we wrote uh asynchronous\r\nread file or synchronous one because the the this\r\none just uses the regular one so what's the deal here so before we explore what actually is\r\ngoing on let's look at the other functions like this one so this file will this one will read the file and\r\nthen use some calculations our CPU bound function that I showed you before but it\r\nwill be written with the async keyword now uh read file and calculate\r\nsynchronously yeah okay so let's take\r\nany small file actually here because it so it computates that stuff\r\nand now look we can't grid because it was blocked by the CPU even\r\nthough you wrote asynchronous in front of it so it actually didn't work\r\nasynchronously we can try it again with anything else like\r\nand it still doesn't return so okay now let's try to do the\r\nsynchronous version of the same thing that will do the very same thing but\r\njust with uh without async keyword in front of it\r\nwe're still uh we can't await our read data file now so we'll just use the\r\nregular read file data and try it again\r\nso where CPU blocking and we get the the other one working at\r\nthe same time without any problem uh and it all does and so not just the\r\nthing here uh I think keyword actually didn't let us didn't\r\nlet our application to be asynchronous so let's see more examples of what can\r\nbe uh achieved with the async keyword\r\nuh let's try uh requests first of all there will be a sink a sync\r\nkeyword in front of regular requests yet that you use as normally\r\nand we'll use that and reading file asynchronously uh so\r\nyes this one so again we're choosing some file\r\nwe're executing and we didn't get it uh\r\nat the same second like uh we did before and now look it took three and a half\r\nseconds and it also blocked our greeting\r\nso now let's try the ICC I think version of it the realizing version\r\nwhich is uh which uses httpx awaits mix different tasks with the same\r\nURLs and basically does the same thing but truly asynchronous use the same so\r\nprevious function took like four seconds instead now this one took just\r\none second and it also actually didn't block the\r\nmain thread one second won't be enough to load both endpoints at the same time\r\nbut we'll try your sleep so we'll sleep for extra five seconds to give us some\r\ntime to check if we can still access the hello world endpoint\r\nso we're loading it and it returns at the same\r\nsecond so it worked actually much better it was faster and didn't block anything\r\nso now let's see why all of those things\r\nbehave the way they did and what we can do to optimize the usage of asynchronous\r\nin first API so what we must note here is that there\r\nWhy things behave not like you might expect\r\nare types of of blocking one of them is CPU bound\r\nblocking is when your computer does some calculations and it's really busy\r\nprocessing uh something so it can do other things and the other thing is uh input output\r\nbound blocking input output bound blocking usually just awaits it\r\nbasically Waits For Stuff to either get through Network it it also includes\r\ndatabases if you connect to your SQL database you're waiting for query to perform there or it can be Network\r\nyou're sending some you're trying to connect to some API or website or it can\r\nbe just regular file reading and uploading so with CPU bound blocking uh\r\nI think IO as you probably might have heard already won't help you that much\r\nbut with io-bound blocking this is why it's called basically sync IO it might\r\nhelp you by by passing waiting time\r\num so if a thing is IO bound blocking uh when\r\nit regularly what it does in its uh sequential programming layer of red\r\nfully consumed CPU uh as you can see here but if you are\r\nusing uh some asynchronous things uh functions then uh it can just switch to\r\nthe other fret while awaiting is happening or it can run several things\r\nat once but the important thing here is that it actually\r\nalways happening in one process in one fret\r\nlet's see uh what happens uh in fast API\r\nbehind when you are trying to run endpoints with the synchronous keyword\r\nso we went to uh uh fast API and it's routing and you\r\nsee here it says run and point function and it looks if what you are passing is\r\ncorrecting so basically if you wrote that it is a weight function and then it\r\nwill be true and if it's a quarantine then it just calls it\r\nand the important part here is if it's not core routine\r\nthen you it's run in fret pool uh what the Fret pool means well red\r\npool is uh basically you have a process and inside that process there are\r\nseparate threads that can do different type of stuff\r\nuh at the same time I will talk about it a bit more in depth\r\nit's like in a minute or two but uh the important part here is if you\r\nwrote a weight then the task won't be run in a thread pool it will be\r\nawaited so if you are trying to pass something that cannot be awaited or that\r\nis actually blocking and write a sync function then it will block the main event pool\r\nit will break the the main thread that's\r\nright in the event Loop and that is why exactly when you write a\r\nsync without actually using something that is true lacing deep down and you might actually be\r\nmaking things a lot slower than they were before so now\r\nlet me show you something that I made to\r\ndemonstrate that the best I can so let's imagine you have several tasks\r\nif you're doing it the regular way uh this will be a task and it will just be\r\nexecution time uh it will just finish one then\r\nfinish one start the other and like that until it finishes then there is that\r\nnon-blocking that asynchronous way um it does this takes all the tasks then\r\nyou use some function like a sink IO gather which we're using in some of our\r\nuh like here what we're sending request so\r\nwe're making several tasks that will uh of sending something to URL\r\nthen we gather the task away and await them\r\nthen it will start it will just make it all five tasks in one big task basically\r\nand then they will be able to start at the same time so you won't be waiting\r\neach one of them to finish and that's why it takes uh way less time so it\r\nfinishes and important thing here is it should be well truly synchronous it uses event\r\nLoop uh well what is the event Loop actually event Loop is just a fancy word\r\nfor uh while true Loop which every cycle\r\nthat runs it asks is it finished yet is it finished did it finish and so forth\r\nand when it's finished it sends the it tells the executor that the some task was finished\r\nif you uh it only creates the illusion of concurrency as I wrote here uh\r\nbecause actually the there is no like many there isn't many threats there\r\nisn't many processes so imagine like this block that we have here is one fret\r\nuh in one process and this one just runs event Loop and because of uh that it\r\nmight bypass some weight so uh you will\r\nbe basically just waiting for stuff at the same time instead of one after\r\nanother so the advantages where it's pretty simple to\r\nuse if you know what you're doing and it's lesser prone that frame which I'll talk about next\r\nuh minus is that you need to kind of know what you're doing because as I showed\r\nthe writing async in front of it just doesn't cut it so you need to use\r\nasynchronous libraries and functions and should won't help you with the CPU\r\nbound tasks because they will still block doesn't matter how you write them then there is multi-freading so what is\r\nthe motive writing well basically now on your imagine that this green\r\nblock is a process it's a virtual or real like you have two cores on your CPU\r\nand four frets and imagine that this is one of those\r\none of those four virtual course or two chords that you have\r\nuh it will connect this will be the memory of that CPU\r\nand you might run several threads on it that will all execute each own thing but\r\nthey will all use the same memory that your CPU uses\r\nso they share a memory within a process one of them can be asynchronous like in\r\nour case so and what we saw a vest API does is that it go it asks uh\r\nfor endpoints to if they are not as if the function is not the synchronous then\r\nthey are run in a separate thread that's why you can actually have like 10 incoming\r\nsynchronous request at the same time uh because just each one of them will go\r\nto different fret so it will be actually asynchronous even though you're just set\r\nthe regular synchronous endpoint and because first API does it under the\r\nhood it does the asynchronous stuff using threads now while we don't use threads all the time for everything else\r\nwell it makes it much more it makes programming more tricky and complicated\r\nbecause it can cause Deadlocks and race conditions so several threats might try\r\nto change the same values and then God knows what happens and it will be very hard to debug and understand what\r\nhappened in the end and then there is python Global interpreter log\r\nthen switching between threads also takes some uh time and some power and if\r\nin some cases it might make it even slightly uh some tasks slightly longer\r\ntakes a little longer but overall it sure will be more efficient if you need to have to process several input bound\r\nstuff at the same time and it also doesn't help us with CPU bound tasks as\r\nI just like uh previous things that we\r\nlooked at and the advantages as well it shares memory so if\r\nlike usually your functions needs to use the same kind of data then every thread\r\ncan access the same data and each process can spend many friends\r\nthreats to run different tasks but and\r\nit's also something when you set up G unicorn web server for example you\r\nusually specify the on the server in production how many threads you need for\r\nit uh usually it recommends something like two times the amount of CPU cores plus\r\none and spending me and since threats also take up memory\r\nuh spending too many threats uh might actually slow down your uh computer\r\nquite a bit so it's not recommended to create too many threads it's something\r\nthat you need to have resources for and next we're going to just multiprocessing\r\nso which this is uh like those same like a multi-freading I told you that this is\r\na process in which those are the threads that I show you here and those will just\r\nbe separate cores let's say of your uh CPU\r\nwhich each has its own cache its own memory access and it is restricted by physical\r\nprocessor cores so you can't have more than you actually have CPUs\r\nso but the advantage here that it finally allows us to run multiple CPU\r\nbound tasks concurrently so at the same time you can calculate three times\r\nfaster if you do multi-process uh and it doesn't share memory but it is\r\nwhich makes it well harder to use for tasks that are directly coupled\r\nso those are basically the types of concurrency that we have I tried to\r\nillustrate the best I could I hope this uh things that I drew make it easier to\r\nunderstand because when you were just reading those threads course multi this multivather\r\nthink it just all turns into one big porridge in your brain and you don't\r\nremember which is one which one is which anymore in the end so\r\nand now let's get to what we should actually do uh\r\nat least what I understand we you must do when using uh concurrency\r\nBest practices\r\nand asynchronous programming in uh fast\r\nAPI for example so first of all file reading if you use\r\nit synchronously like regular it will go to fret\r\nso it won't block if you use it asynchronously\r\nwith the i o files which is a sync library it also goes to Fred because\r\nthat's what the i o files does underneath if you look if the source code it just does the same thing that\r\ntest API is doing for you when you are writing the regular stuff\r\nit just does it implicitly so it actually doesn't matter at all which one you use and the weird part is that even\r\nif you write a thing here it also doesn't block as I showed you so\r\nthey are here I didn't see much difference at all in terms of uh I think\r\nit will just goes to Fred either way so file reading is that way then\r\nI will go to the quest and networking well if you're using uh\r\nsomething that is a support synchronous request regular\r\na library that most people use it doesn't support a sync keyword\r\nso if you're using regular one just use it regularly don't write a sink in front\r\nof it you'll just block the main thread and that's overall something that can be\r\nsaid about all the libraries if it's not I synchronous Library don't write this\r\nthing in front of it if you don't know what if it is just don't write a sink in\r\nfront of it because otherwise you will make it slower because you will block the event threat of the test API because\r\nit wants add inst if you write it with a regular way it will send it to Fred so\r\nit will actually be a synchronous without writing a sync so that's where\r\nsome confusion might stem from if you don't know what you are doing so\r\nand the best thing is sure to use a sync with and gather tasks like here so so\r\nfirst because if you just await each task one after another and don't use the\r\nasync io gather like here it will still be like regular it will just do one\r\nafter another only if you're Gathering tasks then like I should here it will do\r\nall the stuff concurrently which is what we want so\r\noverall use something that supports I think either https\r\nor IO HTTP or something like that that's cool so if you don't then use regular\r\nwithout a thing here so like that and then the databases what\r\nabout databases in my previous video where I showed tutorial of how to do I\r\ndidn't use any async databases it was regularly database so there is no point\r\nin writing a sync in front of every endpoint or function that uses database\r\nthat doesn't support the sync as we know already and the thing is if you don't need to\r\nvery if your application isn't something that needs to be\r\naccessed by like a lot of people like thousands of people\r\nuh a minute or second or an hour at least then the chances are it will just be\r\neasier to use regular databases and write it regular synchronous way because\r\nprobably the regular workers will do just fine with it if you need a higher\r\nload application then use a synchronous databases for it you can't use the\r\nregular wrappers like sqlite or psycho PG instead you need to use the special\r\nones and I wrote here some async Library so request is\r\nthe io HTTP and HTTP hex ophages I think PG there is a library like that then if\r\nyou want SQL Alchemy support but only the core part of the library\r\nso if you're using orm with your database then there is a library called\r\njust database just Google it you almost see it if you are using radius then\r\nthere is IO radius for it so don't just write a sink in front of\r\na synchronous regular libraries and wait for magic to happen because you heard\r\nthat fast API is a synchronous you actually need to use the asynchronous capable libraries with it as well or\r\njust don't use a sync word at all cool and next thing we're going for is\r\ncalculation so what you do about calculations I also\r\num I actually wrote down here so first of all if you can't catch\r\ncomputations then you just should do that maybe if it's inefficient you may\r\nbe just redoing the same thing over and over and then it doesn't make sense and caption can actually reduce the\r\nworkload quite a bit then if you're using just some regular small\r\ncomputations it's a calculating something like for one\r\nor for a second then just use regular synchronous stuff you don't need it then\r\nif it's like something that is blocking for maybe\r\ncouple seconds or so then it's best to use background tasks for it so let me\r\nshow you what background tasks it's something that we are also import from Fast API\r\nand let's see the uh our\r\nendpoint which uses text so we import it as a dependency injection for our\r\nfunction and here we use background tasks\r\nadd task and what we're trying to do so uh\r\nhere we're trying to calculate data for file synchronous that one that takes six\r\nseconds and blocks of ram regularly and here we were also waiting for our uh I\r\nthink read file data so let's try to do that and see if it blocks the Fret like\r\nit regularly did when we didn't use the syntax to refile and calculate synchronous oh again we're sending this\r\nit returned right away okay it returned right away that's the thing\r\nby the way uh that you want if you don't need return data then you can use it\r\nbecause uh but this uh calculation is actually still happening but it's\r\nhappening in the background so you can't actually return something right away so if only if you uh write the result to\r\nlet's say database or do some file or do something but don't need to send it back\r\nright away then use background task so if you as you see the cool thing is it\r\njust returned super fast right away now let's uh try to upload the bigger\r\ndocuments so it doesn't return right away and see if it's blocking now grid\r\nuh returned right away even when this is\r\nstill loading so which and the other one went to the\r\nuh calculating uh so it doesn't Block Main thread and\r\nit also returns instantly so it's a good thing to do when you have a CPU bound\r\ntest which doesn't need to return right away so that's pretty cool other thing that\r\nyou can do is uh to just send it to uh\r\nexplicitly to a separate process and to send your task the CPU Banton\r\nhere I'm trying to do that so I uh made a function called run and process\r\nand it's uh yet the event Loop of rising IO and then it awaits it running in\r\nexecutor like that so uh let's see so\r\nI'm creating again uh tasks that I'm gathering later I'm reading file data\r\nand I'm trying to run this process with these arguments in the same thread and\r\npass into tasks Now read file and calculate\r\nsynchronously it's also pretty uh cool thing\r\nnow look let's say I am important this thing so it doesn't block\r\nthe main thread because you see it returned right away here which is good\r\nbecause the regular uh because regularly if you just write the\r\nCPU bound thing it blocks main thread so it didn't block it didn't return right\r\naway like background tasks did but it returned us the result after it was done\r\nso it says it took six seconds which was our CPU bound task how much it took\r\nand we got returned we got our async function\r\nand it just was uh doing it in a separate process so it's also cool thing\r\nthat uh might be handy when you have some average size not very heavy\r\ncomputations that you still need to return them but don't want to block main thread with\r\nso yes and uh in the end\r\nwhat you can do uh if you have what math what you must\r\ndo if you have a large actually some large CPU bound tasks that take maybe\r\ndozens of seconds sure you can't allow it to block your whole uh application\r\nuh because it just won't be able to do anything so for any heavy computations\r\njust also don't use background tasks because it's kind of not a good way so\r\nthe industry standard is to just run it in a separate worker and use usually use\r\nsalary and radius or rabbit and Q with it for\r\nthat kind of stuff so yeah use that\r\nQuick recap\r\nokay so here will be a quick recap I know the video was actually 40 minutes\r\nlong and not everyone has that kind of time but I tried my best to not uh waste\r\nyour time and explain why exactly some\r\nthings are the way they are so that you just uh get some sense in how to how it\r\nworks overall later so if you have time watch the\r\nwhole video if you skipped uh previous right okay\r\nso let's sum this up if you have async functions use a sync library if you're\r\nusing async functions gather tasks so they run concurrently\r\nif you have computations run it in separate process so use the\r\nworker for it or run them as a background if you don't need the return right away\r\nuh or at all rather if you need to read file data or\r\nsomething uh just you can just read it regularly\r\nit will send it to Fred don't write the sink in front of stuff\r\nthat isn't actually I think\r\nuh what else ah one other thing I can just mention is actually when you read\r\nin file data here I'm just doing fire read but uh read it in chunks because if\r\nI'm sending let's say two gigabyte a file in the end it will take two gigabytes of\r\nmy memory and M memory isn't endless so maybe someone will send a 14 gigabyte\r\nfile and maybe you don't even have that much memory then it will just fail on the end so uh read it in chunks uh like\r\nsmall uh it's just makes more sense to read it\r\nlike as one megabyte or eight megabyte chunks it might actually take slightly\r\nlonger but the it's just much better to do it this way so so what else we got database if you\r\ndon't and need a very high load stuff just to use regular database and without\r\nasync just will be easier and it won't make much difference to you anyway\r\nso concurrency can be a little tricky as you see I need to also kind of tricky\r\nfor me and I've been also struggling to understand all the concepts myself\r\nbecause every thing is so just confusing about it\r\nand the most resources don't help and also there are a lot of uh kind of just\r\nbad videos with those bad practices like using synchronous stuff with I think keywords something like that we see why\r\nit's a bad idea"

Dat betekent: **je hele app hangt** zolang die functie bezig is. En dat is precies wat hij in de video demonstreert met die `greeting` endpoint die niet meer reageert.---\n\nWil je dat ik je help kiezen tussen optie 1 en 2?"

Zet overal waar je ze aanroept een `await` voor\n\nBijvoorbeeld:\n\n```python\n# In je FastAPI endpoint\n@app.post('/message')\nasync def handle_message(message: Message):\n    if message.action_type:\n        return await communication_manager.handle_action(message)\n    elif message.trigger_type:\n        return await communication_manager.handle_trigger(message)```\n\nEn dan in je `CommunicationManager`:\n\n```python\nclass CommunicationManager:...\n\n    async def handle_action(self, message: Message) -> str:\n        if message.action_type == ActionType.PUSH_SUMMARY:\n            async with asyncio.Lock():\n                if message.payload:\n                    self.summary = message.payload.get(\"text\", \"\")\n                    print(f\"Summary updated to: '{self.summary}'\")\n                    return \"summary updated\"\n                else:\n                    print(\"Warning - payload was missing.\")\n                    return \"warning - payload was missing\"...```\n\n> Let op: je gebruikt nu een `threading.Lock()`, maar in een async context moet je `asyncio.Lock()` gebruiken. Die moet je dan ook `async with` gebruiken.---\n\nWil je dat ik je help met het refactoren van `CommunicationManager` naar volledig async, inclusief de juiste locks?"

    "content": "Top. Hier is een overzicht van **alle plekken buiten `CommunicationManager`** die je moet aanpassen om alles echt async te maken:---\n\n### 🔧 1. `handle_message` endpoint in FastAPI\nJe moet `await` gebruiken bij het aanroepen van `handle_action` en `handle_trigger`:\n\n```python\n@app.post('/message')\nasync def handle_message(message: Message):\n    if message.action_type:\n        return await communication_manager.handle_action(message)\n    elif message.trigger_type:\n        return await communication_manager.handle_trigger(message)```---\n\n### 🔧 2. `main()` functie\nIn je `main()` loop gebruik je:\n\n```python\ncommunication_manager.add_user_message(user_input)...\ncommunication_manager.add_assistant_message(response_text)```\n\nDeze methodes zijn nu sync, maar als we `CommunicationManager` async maken, moeten deze ook `async def` worden. Dus je moet ze dan zo aanroepen:\n\n```python\nawait communication_manager.add_user_message(user_input)...\nawait communication_manager.add_assistant_message(response_text)```---\n\n### 🔧 3. `process_incoming_message()`\nZelfde verhaal: je roept nu aan:\n\n```python\nif note_received.is_set():\n    communication_manager.process_incoming_message()```\n\nDat wordt:\n\n```python\nif note_received.is_set():\n    await communication_manager.process_incoming_message()```---\n\n### 🔧 4. `get_messages()` en `get_summary()`\nJe gebruikt deze in `main()` en mogelijk elders. Die moeten `async def` worden, dus je moet ze ook overal met `await` aanroepen:\n\n```python\nresponse_text = await chat_with_llm(client, await communication_manager.get_messages())```---\n\n### 🔧 5. `set_messages()` en `load_summary()`\nAls je die ergens gebruikt (bijv. bij opstarten of saven), dan moeten die ook async worden en met `await` aangeroepen worden.---\n\n### 🔧 6. Lock vervangen\nJe gebruikt nu `threading.Lock()`:\n\n```python\nself._lock = threading.Lock()```\n\nDie moet worden vervangen door:\n\n```python\nself._lock = asyncio.Lock()```\n\nEn dan moet je overal `with self._lock:` vervangen door `async with self._lock:`.---\n\n### ✅ Samenvatting van wat je moet aanpassen buiten `CommunicationManager`:\n| Locatie | Wat je moet doen ||--------|------------------|\n| `/message` endpoint | `await` gebruiken bij `handle_action` en `handle_trigger` |\n| `main()` | `await` gebruiken bij `add_user_message`, `add_assistant_message`, `get_messages`, `process_incoming_message` |\n| Overige functies | `await` gebruiken bij `get_summary`, `set_messages`, `load_summary` |\n| Locking | `threading.Lock()` → `asyncio.Lock()` en `with` → `async with` |---\n\nWil je dat ik nu de `CommunicationManager` voor je async refactor?"
